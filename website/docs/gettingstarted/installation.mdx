# Installation

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 10
- MacOS x64 & arm64 (due October '21)
- Linux (due December '21)

## Dependencies

Wails has a number of common dependencies that are required before installation:

- Go 1.17+
- npm (Node 14+)

### Go

Download Go from the [Go Downloads Page](https://golang.org/dl/).

Ensure that you follow the official [Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install#install). You will also need to ensure that your `PATH` environment variable also includes the path to your `~/go/bin` directory. Restart your terminal and do the following checks:

- Check Go is installed correctly: `go version`
- Check "~/go/bin" is in your PATH variable: `echo $PATH | grep go/bin`

### npm

Download NPM from the [Node Downloads Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It is best to use the latest release as that is what we generally test against.

Run `npm --version` to verify.

## Platform Specific Dependencies

You will also need to install platform specific dependencies:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Windows"
  values={[
    { label: "Windows", value: "Windows" },
    { label: "MacOS", value: "MacOS" },
    { label: "Linux", value: "Linux" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="MacOS">Coming Soon...</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Windows">
    Wails requires that the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a>{" "}
    runtime is installed. Some Windows installations will already have this installed. You can check using the{" "}
    <code>wails doctor</code> command (see below).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linux">Coming Soon...</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## System Check

Running `wails doctor` will check if you have the correct dependencies installed. If not, it will advise on what is missing and help on how to rectify any problems.
