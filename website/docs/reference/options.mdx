## Application Options

The `Options.App` struct contains the application configuration.
It is passed to the `wails.Run()` method:

```go title="Example"
import "github.com/sergey-shpilevskiy/wails/v2/pkg/options"

func main() {

    err := wails.Run(&options.App{
        Title:             "Menus Demo",
        Width:             800,
        Height:            600,
        DisableResize:     false,
        Fullscreen:        false,
        Frameless:         true,
        MinWidth:          400,
        MinHeight:         400,
        MaxWidth:          1280,
        MaxHeight:         1024,
        StartHidden:       false,
        HideWindowOnClose: false,
        RGBA:              &options.RGBA{R: 0, G: 0, B: 0, A: 255},
        Assets:            assets,
        Menu:              app.applicationMenu(),
        Logger:            nil,
        LogLevel:          logger.DEBUG,
        OnStartup:         app.startup,
        OnDomReady:        app.domready,
        OnShutdown:        app.shutdown,
        Bind: []interface{}{
            app,
        },
        Windows: &windows.Options{
            WebviewIsTransparent: false,
            WindowIsTranslucent:  false,
            DisableWindowIcon:    false,
        },
    })
